Once you clone the repo, run "npm install" the get the libraries since we don't copy node_modules on the repo.

To make changes or add something new, use your own branch ex: oguz branch, save, commit.

After editing code, to see your changes locally, run "npm start"

If you like what you have done, and push to your branch. Then pull request (PR) and merge to development branch. Then create a PR to merge development to production and ask someone to review and make the merge.
